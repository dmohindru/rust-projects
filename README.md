# Rust Learning Journey

A progressive roadmap of Rust projects designed to build expertise from fundamentals to advanced systems programming. Each project increases in complexity while reinforcing core Rust concepts through practical, professional-grade applications.

## Learning Philosophy

This roadmap follows a hands-on approach to learning Rust, moving from reading about concepts to implementing them in real-world scenarios. Each project is designed to:

- Build upon previous concepts while introducing new ones
- Mirror professional development practices
- Include comprehensive testing (TDD approach)
- Use external libraries and modern Rust ecosystem
- Provide 2-4 weeks of engaging development work

**Prerequisites:**

- Completed "The Rust Programming Language" book
- Experience with backend/frontend development in other languages
- Familiarity with concepts like HTTP, databases, and concurrent programming
